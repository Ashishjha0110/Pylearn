#String and its functions
## Facts: We can use single as well as double quotes 
## for the string representation in Python.
## There is another way to represent this, which is the long string. It uses triple quotes. 
##Example 1
# username = 'Ashish'
# password= "Jha0194"
# long_String = ''' 
# WOW
# 0 0
# ( )
# '''
# print (long_String)

##Adding two strings using the '+' operator/ String Concatenation
##Example 2
First_String= 'Life goes'
Second_String= 'On On'
Final_String= First_String+' '+Second_String
print (Final_String)
