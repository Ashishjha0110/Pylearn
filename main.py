#tuple
# the tuples are list but the major difference is that it is immutable. As it is immutable it is faster than list but we can not perform sort or reverse on the tuple.

#As the tuples are immutable so it can be used as the key in the dictionary.

My_tup= (1,2,3,4,4)

#Methods
# the tuple has only 2 methods count and index
# count & index 
# its working is same that we performed in the list section
print(My_tup.count(4))
print(My_tup.index(3))
print(len(My_tup))
